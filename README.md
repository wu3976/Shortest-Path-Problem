# Shortest-Path-Problem
Given a weighted, non-negative edge graph, what is the shortest path between two selected nodes? What is the length of such a path? <br/>
In 1959, Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra conceived and published the infamous Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm. This algorithm 
is widely used in fields of artifitial intelligence, machine learning, game designs, etc. <br />
This program makes use of javascript's object to implement Dijkstra's algorithm. In "Customization Area", 
specify these configurations: <br><br>
path -> The absolute or relative path of a file in CSV format, representing a graph. <br>
start -> The starting node of the shortest path you want to find. <br>
end -> The ending node of the path. <br>
default_graph -> If path is set to "./default", this graph would be used instead. <br>
<br>
Then, navigate to the directory of this program, type in command line: <br>
> node Dijkstra.js

The results would be shown on console.
