# Shortest-Path-Problem
Given a weighted, non-negative edge graph, what is the shortest path between two selected nodes? What is the length of such a path? 
In 1959, Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra conceived and published the infamous Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm. This algorithm 
is widely used in fields of artifitial intelligence, machine learning, game designs, etc. 
This program makes use of javascript's object to implement Dijkstra's algorithm.
